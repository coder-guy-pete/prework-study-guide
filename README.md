# 2024 Bootcamp Pre-work Study Guide

## Description
This project is my first step into becoming a programmer. I have been working in the tech industry since 2016, and I have slowly been becoming more technical throughout my career. Programming and being more technical is the logical next step for me and I am excited to be on this journey.

This intro project helped me build a fundamental knowledge base that I will continue to apply throughout the bootcamp. The introductions to HTML, CSS, Git, Github, and Javascript were all useful, but the real benefit of this intro project was to help me start to think like a developer, to get into a routine of working through software development problems, and to introduce me to the tools we would be utilizing throughout the bootcamp.
